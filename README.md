*dot* (aka Deepfake Offensive Toolkit) makes real-time, controllable deepfakes ready for virtual cameras injection. *dot* is created for performing penetration testing against e.g. identity verification and video conferencing systems, for the use by security analysts, Red Team members, and biometrics researchers.

If you want to learn more about *dot* is used for penetration tests with deepfakes in the industry, read these articles by [The Verge](https://www.theverge.com/2022/5/18/23092964/deepfake-attack-facial-recognition-liveness-test-banks-sensity-report) and [Biometric Update](https://www.biometricupdate.com/202205/sensity-alleges-biometric-onboarding-providers-downplaying-deepfake-threat)

dot *is developed for research and demonstration purposes. As an end user, you have the responsibility to obey all applicable laws when using this program. Authors and contributing developers assume no liability and are not responsible for any misuse or damage caused by the use of this program.*

</p>

## How it works

In a nutshell, *dot* works like this

```text
    __________________      _____________________________      __________________________
   | your webcam feed | -> | suite of realtime deepfakes | -> | virtual camera injection |
    ------------------      -----------------------------      --------------------------
```

All deepfakes supported by *dot* do not require additional training. They can be used
in real-time on the fly on a photo that becomes the target of face impersonation.
Supported methods:

- face swap (via [SimSwap](https://github.com/neuralchen/SimSwap)), at resolutions `224` and `512`
  - with the option of face superresolution (via [GPen](https://github.com/yangxy/GPEN)) at resolutions `256` and `512`
- lower quality face swap (via OpenCV)
- [FOMM](https://github.com/AliaksandrSiarohin/first-order-model), First Order Motion Model for image animation

## Installation

### Install Pre-requisites

- Linux

    ```bash
    sudo apt install ffmpeg cmake
    ```

- MacOS

    ```bash
    brew install ffmpeg cmake
    ```

### Create Conda Environment

> The instructions assumes that you have Miniconda installed on your machine. If you don't, you can refer to this [link](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/install/index.html) for installation instructions.

#### With GPU Support

```bash
conda env create -f envs/environment-gpu.yaml
conda activate dot
```

Install the `torch` and `torchvision` dependencies based on the CUDA version installed on your machine:

- Install `cudatoolkit` from `conda`: `conda install cudatoolkit=<cuda_version_no>` (replace `<cuda_version_no>` with the version on your machine)
- Install `torch` and `torchvision` dependencies: `pip install torch==1.9.0+<cuda_tag> torchvision==0.10.0+<cuda_tag> -f https://download.pytorch.org/whl/torch_stable.html`, where `<cuda_tag>` is the CUDA tag defined by Pytorch. For example, `pip install torch==1.9.0+cu111 torchvision==0.10.0+cu111 -f https://download.pytorch.org/whl/torch_stable.html` for CUDA 11.1. See [here](https://pytorch.org/get-started/previous-versions/) for a list of all available `torch` and `torchvision` versions.

To check that `torch` and `torchvision` are installed correctly, run the following command: `python -c "import torch; print(torch.cuda.is_available())"`. If the output is `True`, the dependencies are installed with CUDA support.

#### With CPU Support (slow, not recommended)

```bash
conda env create -f envs/environment-cpu.yaml
conda activate dot
```

### Install dot

```bash
pip install -e .
```

### Download Models

-   Download GitHub Release binaries from [here](https://github.com/sensity-ai/dot/releases/tag/1.0.0) or use the following `wget` commands:

    ```bash
    wget https://github.com/sensity-ai/dot/releases/download/1.0.0/dot_model_checkpoints.z01 \
    && wget https://github.com/sensity-ai/dot/releases/download/1.0.0/dot_model_checkpoints.z02 \
    && wget https://github.com/sensity-ai/dot/releases/download/1.0.0/dot_model_checkpoints.zip
    ```

-   Unzip the binaries and place them in the root directory of the repository:

    ```bash
    zip -s 0 dot_model_checkpoints.zip --out saved_models.zip \
    && unzip saved_models.zip
    ```

-   Clean up the downloaded binaries:

    ```bash
    rm -rf *.z*
    ```

## Usage

### Running dot

Run `dot --help` to get a full list of available options.

1. Simswap

    ```bash
    dot \
    -c ./configs/simswap.yaml \
    --target 0 \
    --source "./data" \
    --show_fps \
    --use_gpu
    ```

2. SimSwapHQ

    ```bash
    dot \
    -c ./configs/simswaphq.yaml \
    --target 0 \
    --source "./data" \
    --show_fps \
    --use_gpu
    ```

3. FOMM

    ```bash
    dot \
    -c ./configs/fomm.yaml \
    --target 0 \
    --source "./data" \
    --show_fps \
    --use_gpu
    ```

4. FaceSwap

    ```bash
    dot \
    -c ./configs/faceswap.yaml \
    --target 0 \
    --source "./data" \
    --show_fps \
    --use_gpu
    ```

**Note**: To enable face superresolution, use the flag `--gpen_type gpen_256` or `--gpen_type gpen_512`. To use *dot* on CPU (not recommended), do not pass the `--use_gpu` flag.

### Controlling dot

> **Disclaimer**: We use the `SimSwap` technique for the following demonstration

Running *dot* via any of the above methods generates real-time Deepfake on the input video feed using source images from the `data/` folder.

<p align="center">

</p>

When running *dot* a list of available control options appear on the terminal window as shown above. You can toggle through and select different source images by pressing the associated control key.

Watch the following demo video for better understanding of the control options:

## Virtual Camera Injection

Instructions vary depending on your operating system.

### Windows

- Install [OBS Studio](https://obsproject.com/).

- Install [VirtualCam plugin](https://obsproject.com/forum/resources/obs-virtualcam.539/).

Choose `Install and register only 1 virtual camera`.

- Run OBS Studio.

- In the Sources section, press on Add button ("+" sign),

  select Windows Capture and press OK. In the appeared window,
  choose "[python.exe]: fomm" in Window drop-down menu and press OK.
  Then select Edit -> Transform -> Fit to screen.

- In OBS Studio, go to Tools -> VirtualCam. Check AutoStart,

  set Buffered Frames to 0 and press Start.

- Now `OBS-Camera` camera should be available in Zoom

  (or other videoconferencing software).

### Ubuntu

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install v4l-utils v4l2loopback-dkms v4l2loopback-utils
sudo modprobe v4l2loopback devices=1 card_label="OBS Cam" exclusive_caps=1
v4l2-ctl --list-devices
sudo add-apt-repository ppa:obsproject/obs-studio
sudo apt install obs-studio
```

Open `OBS Studio` and check if `tools --> v4l2sink` exists.
If it doesn't follow these instructions:

```bash
mkdir -p ~/.config/obs-studio/plugins/v4l2sink/bin/64bit/
ln -s /usr/lib/obs-plugins/v4l2sink.so ~/.config/obs-studio/plugins/v4l2sink/bin/64bit/
```

Use the virtual camera with `OBS Studio`:

- Open `OBS Studio`
- Go to `tools --> v4l2sink`
- Select `/dev/video2` and `YUV420`
- Click on `start`
- Join a meeting and select `OBS Cam`

### MacOS

- Download and install OBS Studio for MacOS from [here](https://obsproject.com/)
- Open OBS and follow the first-time setup (you might be required to enable certain permissions in *System Preferences*)
- Run *dot* with `--use_cam` flag to enable camera feed
- Click the "+" button in the sources section → select "Windows Capture", create a new source and enter "OK" → select window with "python" included in the name and enter OK
- Click "Start Virtual Camera" button in the controls section
- Select "OBS Cam" as default camera in the video settings of the application target of the injection
